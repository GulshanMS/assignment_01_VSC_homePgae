# VS Code Home Page - Web Development Journey

This is a simple project where I recreated a VS Code home page to demonstrate my understanding of web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project marks the completion of my initial learning phase in web development.

## Overview

The project is a basic replica of the VS Code homepage. It showcases the skills I've learned in the following areas:

- **HTML**: Building the structure of the page, including headers, navigation bars, and content sections.
- **CSS**: Styling the page to resemble the VS Code homepage, including layout techniques, colors, and fonts.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity, such as dynamic content loading or user interface improvements.

## Features

- A responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Custom styling mimicking the aesthetic of the VS Code homepage.
- Interactive elements using basic JavaScript (e.g., toggle buttons, interactive menus, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features and behavior.
